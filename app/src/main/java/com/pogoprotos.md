* Get POGOProtos, whichever version you want, from [here](https://github.com/AeonLucid/POGOProtos).
* Get protoc version 3.0.0 from [here](https://github.com/google/protobuf/releases).
* Go for pretty compilation for Java as described in POGOProtos readme. Don't forget to give script a hint on where protoc is.
* Copy results of compilation here, so folder "github" will be beside folder "elynx"
* Build the app, it should be possible now
